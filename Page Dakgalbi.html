		This is the dish that I often got to hang out with my friends and it was perfect when we were craving for something spicy. Especially with cheese and cheese ricecake, it tastes the best! 
		<br>
		<br>
		Dakgalbi is a popular Korean dish made with marinated chicken, stir-fried with vegetables and a spicy sauce. It originated in the city of Chuncheon in Gangwon Province, South Korea.
		<br>
		<br>
		The dish typically consists of bite-sized pieces of chicken marinated in a spicy gochujang (red pepper paste) sauce, along with sweet potatoes, cabbage, scallions, and other vegetables. The ingredients are stir-fried together in a large pan or wok until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender.
		<br>
		<br>
		Dakgalbi is often served with rice, lettuce leaves, and other side dishes such as kimchi and pickled radishes. It is also common to add cheese to the dish, which is melted on top of the dakgalbi towards the end of the cooking process.
		<br>
		<br>
		I love to eat fried rice based on the sauce of Dakgalbi at the end. I can say that I eat Dakgalbi for the friedrice.
